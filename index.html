      <p><span class="first-character sc">I</span>in collaboration with John Buckley, an Illinois Tech alumnus, on planning and designing a remote astronomy site. This astronomy site will be located within a 100-mile radius of Denver and will feature a large amphitheater, telescopes and telescope platforms, as well as lodging for visitors. Buckley's vision for this project is that it would not only be a place for experienced astronomers, but a place where students and other visitors would learn more about science and technology through astronomy.</p>
      <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
      <p class="margin-top-10">This student team working on this part of the project is responsible for drawing plans for the layout of
        the site. This involves researching the details surrounding what it would take to build an amphitheater, telescope platforms,
        and living facilities for visitors to the site. Another major focus of the project is investigating how the astronomy site can
        be powered by renewable energy, particularly geothermal and solar energy. The team will be responsible for determining the power
        needs of the facilities, as well as how much solar and geothermal energy will need to be harvested for the
        astronomy site to run. It is also is responsible for integrating the telescope's camera with IBM's Watson machine learning program. The main task that the group will
         be working on is writing a program that will allow the telescope/camera system to communicate with IBM's CTN. </p>
      <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
      <p class="margin-top-10">The second part of the project is done in
         collaboration with IBM. The Takahashi 5-inch telescope will be a
          part of the Cognitive Telescope Network (CTN) project. Along
          with other colleges and universities, the CTN's goal is to
           collect data from telescopes scattered across the country to
           better help astronomers view transient astronomical events.
           Through this project, IBM has plans to
        build an interactive app based on the astronomical data.</p>
